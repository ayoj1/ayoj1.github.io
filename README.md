This repository contains the codes and files for my personal portfolio website (https://cmis300.isg.siue.edu/~ajimoh) that I designed as a student in SIUE while I was enrolled in CMIS 300. The website showcases my personal information, resume, skills, projects, and contact info. It was built using PHP, CSS, and JavaScript.
